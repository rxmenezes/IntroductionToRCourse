# Loading data from txt {#firstLoad}

For the quick exercises we will mostly work with the `survey` data. Let us load them into R.

- Copy the file  `survey.txt` into your data folder

- Load this new data set into R and call it `survey`

```{r eval=1, echo=2}
survey <- read.delim("../../data/survey.txt")

```

- View it

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(survey)
```

# Making a script {#firstScript}

We will make a script to read in the pulse and survey datasets. We will use this script every day in the course.

- Start a new script that reads in the pulse and survey data sets

- Add a comment to the script

- Save the script under a useful name

- Check it by closing and opening RStudio, running the script and then checking that the objects containing the datasets are loaded in the workspace (HINT: make sure you are in the right project)
